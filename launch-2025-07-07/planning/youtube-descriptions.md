## Video 2: Voice Coding Demo (3 minutes)

**Title**: I Code 3x Faster Using Voice - Here's My $0.02/Hour Setup

**Description**:
```
Watch how I use voice to code faster than typing with Whispering (free, open source) + Claude Code. This setup costs me $0.02/hour and has completely changed how I write code.

GitHub: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering

In this demo:
- Real-time voice coding with Whispering
- Integration with Claude Code
- Hands-free development workflow
- Building features by talking through them

My setup:
- Whispering for transcription (free app, $0.02/hr with Groq)
- Claude Code for AI assistance
- Voice-activated mode for hands-free coding

Why voice coding?
- Faster for boilerplate and documentation
- Natural for explaining complex logic
- Reduces typing fatigue/RSI
- Better flow state when thinking out loud

Whispering is 100% free and open source. You bring your own API key and pay providers directly - no $30/month subscriptions.
