I just launched Whispering - a completely free, open-source transcription app that's saving users hundreds of dollars per year.

**The Problem:** Transcription apps charge $15-30/month for what's essentially a wrapper around APIs you could use directly.

**The Solution:** Whispering lets you bring your own API key and pay cents, not dollars.

✅ 100% free and open source
✅ Your data never touches our servers
✅ Pay only for what you use (typically $0.02-0.18/hour)
✅ No subscriptions, no limits, no premium tiers

I built this for myself and used it daily for months before discovering competitors were charging monthly fees. When I saw the pricing, I knew I had to open source it.

**For Professionals:**
- Create content faster with voice
- Maintain complete privacy and data ownership
- Save $180-360/year on transcription costs

Built with modern tech (Svelte 5 + Tauri) for blazing fast performance on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
