# Page SEO and Documentation Update

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Feature**: Add page titles, meta descriptions, and update README

## Overview

This task adds descriptive page titles and meta descriptions to the SvelteKit application and updates the project README to reflect these improvements. The goal is to improve SEO and user experience while accurately representing the flexible deployment model.

## Target Audience & Deployment Model

Developers who value:
- **Self-hosted AI**: Run OpenCode locally with no cloud dependency
- **Privacy**: Code never leaves your machine (even when using cloud UI)
- **Flexible deployment**: Can run fully local OR use cloud-hosted UI with tunneled connections
- **Open source transparency**: Audit the code, no tracking

### Deployment Scenarios
1. **Fully Local**: Both epicenter.sh and OpenCode run locally
2. **Hybrid Cloud**: epicenter.sh on Cloudflare Pages, OpenCode local via ngrok tunnel
3. **Assisted Setup**: You help users configure tunneling/proxying for cloud access

## Todo Items

- [ ] Add `<svelte:head>` block to homepage (`/apps/sh/src/routes/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Add `<svelte:head>` block to assistants list (`/apps/sh/src/routes/(app)/assistants/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Add `<svelte:head>` block to assistant detail (`/apps/sh/src/routes/(app)/assistants/[id]/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Add `<svelte:head>` block to session page (`/apps/sh/src/routes/(app)/assistants/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Update README.md to clarify deployment flexibility
- [ ] Add screenshot update note to README
- [ ] Run lint and type checks
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Commit changes

## Implementation Details

### Page Titles and Descriptions

**Homepage**
- Title: `epicenter.sh - Web Interface for Self-Hosted AI Coding`
- Description: `Connect to OpenCode servers from your browser. Run fully local or tunnel through ngrok. Your code stays on your machine, even with cloud deployment.`

**Assistants Page**
- Title: `Assistants - Manage Your OpenCode Connections | epicenter.sh`
- Description: `Connect to OpenCode servers running locally or tunneled through ngrok. Manage multiple AI assistants for different codebases.`

**Assistant Detail Page**
- Title: `{assistantConfig.name} Sessions | epicenter.sh`
- Description: `View and manage chat sessions with your {assistantConfig.name} OpenCode assistant. Direct local connection or secure tunnel access.`

**Session Page**
- Title: `{session.title || 'Untitled Session'} - {assistantConfig.name} | epicenter.sh`
- Description: `Chat with your local codebase through OpenCode. Ask questions, get explanations, and work with AI that has full project context.`

### Content Guidelines

- Format: "Page Name - epicenter.sh" (except homepage)
- Emphasize **deployment flexibility**: local AND cloud options
- Highlight that **code stays local** even with cloud UI
- Mention **tunneling/proxying** capabilities for hybrid setups
- Avoid AI buzzwords ("revolutionary", "powerful", "seamless")
- Use reactive variables for dynamic content
- Keep meta descriptions under 160 characters

### README Updates

1. **Clarify deployment model**: 
   - Fully local development
   - Cloud deployment with local OpenCode (via tunnels)
   - Assisted setup for hybrid configurations

2. **Update features list** to reflect:
   - Web interface for local OR remote OpenCode servers
   - Flexible deployment (local, cloud, hybrid)
   - Secure tunneling support (ngrok integration)
   - Privacy-first (code never leaves your machine)

3. **Refine usage instructions** to mention:
   - Local development workflow
   - Cloud deployment with tunneling
   - Assistant setup guide reference

4. **Add screenshot update placeholder**

5. **Maintain hacker-friendly tone**

## Technical Considerations

- `<svelte:head>` blocks go directly after `<script>` tags
- Dynamic pages use string interpolation with reactive variables
- Verify all required variables are available in page context
- Ensure meta descriptions stay under character limit
- Reference existing assistant-setup-guide.md for technical details

## Key Messaging Updates

**Before**: "Self-hosted only, no cloud"
**After**: "Self-hosted AI with flexible deployment - run fully local or use cloud UI with tunneled connections"

This better reflects that:
- OpenCode always runs locally (code never leaves machine)
- epicenter.sh can run locally OR in cloud
- You provide setup assistance for hybrid configurations
- Privacy is maintained regardless of deployment choice
