# UI Components Monorepo Refactor

## Overview
Move all UI components from `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/` to a new shared package at `/packages/ui/` to enable reuse across the monorepo.

## Current State
- UI components are located in `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/`
- Components are imported using `$lib/components/ui/[component]`
- 26 component folders containing shadcn-svelte components
- Components use both named exports and namespace imports

## Proposed Structure

### New Package Location

**Option 1: Direct in src (Recommended)**
```
packages/
  ui/
    src/
      accordion/
      alert/
      badge/
      button/
      card/
      checkbox/
      command/
      dialog/
      dropdown-menu/
      input/
      label/
      popover/
      resizable/
      scroll-area/
      section-header/
      select/
      separator/
      skeleton/
      switch/
      table/
      textarea/
      toggle/
      toggle-group/
      utils.ts        # cn() utility function
      index.ts        # Optional: barrel export for all components
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
```

**Option 2: Components subdirectory**
```
packages/
  ui/
    src/
      components/
        accordion/
        alert/
        ... (all components)
      utils/
        cn.ts
      index.ts
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
```

### Package Configuration
The `packages/ui/package.json` will use wildcards in the exports field:

```json
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./*": "./src/*/index.ts",
    "./utils": "./src/utils.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bits-ui": "^0.21.16",
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.5.5",
    "tailwind-variants": "^0.3.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "svelte": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^22.15.32",
    "typescript": "^5.7.3"
  }
}
```

### Import Changes
All imports will change from:
```typescript
import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';
import * as Dialog from '$lib/components/ui/dialog';
```

To:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@repo/ui/button';
import * as Dialog from '@repo/ui/dialog';
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Package Structure
- [ ] Create `/packages/ui/` directory
- [ ] Create `package.json` with exports configuration
- [ ] Create `tsconfig.json` extending base config
- [ ] Create `src/ui/` directory structure

### Phase 2: Move Components
- [ ] Copy all component folders from `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/` to `/packages/ui/src/`
- [ ] Update any internal component imports (e.g., toggle-group importing from toggle)
- [ ] Move the `cn` utility function to `/packages/ui/src/utils.ts`

### Phase 3: Update App Dependencies
- [ ] Add `@repo/ui` as a dependency in `/apps/whispering/package.json`
- [ ] Update all imports in the app to use `@repo/ui/[component]`
- [ ] Remove the old `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/` directory

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run build to ensure all imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Test that all components render properly
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types are working correctly

## Considerations

### Dependencies
- The UI package will need its own dependencies (bits-ui, clsx, tailwind-merge, etc.)
- Svelte should be a peer dependency
- The `$lib/utils` import in components needs to be handled (either moved to ui package or passed as props)

### Tailwind Configuration
- The UI package will need access to the Tailwind configuration
- Consider if the UI package should have its own tailwind.config or use the app's

### Component Utilities
- The `cn()` utility function is used by most components
- This should be included in the UI package or imported from a shared utilities package

### Build Process
- The UI package should be built as ES modules
- Consider if components need to be pre-compiled or if they should remain as .svelte files

## Benefits
1. **Reusability**: UI components can be used across multiple apps in the monorepo
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundary between UI components and app logic
3. **Independent Versioning**: UI package can be versioned independently
4. **Better Testing**: UI components can be tested in isolation

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **Import Path Changes**: All imports need updating (can be automated with search/replace)
2. **Build Complexity**: Need to ensure proper build order in monorepo
3. **Type Resolution**: TypeScript needs proper configuration to resolve @repo/ui imports

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Symlinking**: Could symlink the ui folder, but this doesn't provide proper package boundaries
2. **Git Submodules**: More complex and doesn't integrate well with PNPM workspaces
3. **Publishing to NPM**: Overkill for internal components

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create the package structure
3. Move components incrementally to test the setup
4. Update all imports once confirmed working

## Review

### Changes Completed

1. **Created packages/ui structure** - All UI components have been successfully moved from `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/` to `/packages/ui/src/`

2. **Updated imports** - All imports in the app have been changed from `$lib/components/ui/[component]` to `@repo/ui/[component]`

3. **Fixed package dependencies**:
   - Added `@repo/ui` as a workspace dependency in apps/whispering
   - Added required dependencies to packages/ui: @lucide/svelte, paneforge
   - Added peer dependencies: @tanstack/svelte-table

4. **Fixed internal imports** - Updated all internal imports within packages/ui to use relative paths instead of @repo/ui

5. **Removed old UI directory** - Successfully deleted `/apps/whispering/src/lib/components/ui/`

### Remaining Issues

The build currently fails due to bits-ui version incompatibility. The version of bits-ui (0.21.16) doesn't export some components that the code expects (Command, Portal, etc.). This appears to be due to API changes between bits-ui versions.

### Recommendations

1. **Update bits-ui components** - The shadcn-svelte components need to be regenerated or updated to match the current bits-ui API
2. **Version alignment** - Ensure all UI components are compatible with the current versions of their dependencies
3. **Consider using shadcn-svelte CLI** - Use `bunx shadcn-svelte@latest add` to regenerate components with correct imports

### Benefits Achieved

Despite the build issues, the refactor has successfully:
- Separated UI components into a reusable package
- Established proper package boundaries
- Set up the foundation for sharing UI components across the monorepo
- Improved code organization and maintainability
