How I capture every thought hands-free while working on other tasks

## Post Content

Hey r/productivity!

I've discovered a new way to capture thoughts without interrupting my workflow: completely hands-free voice transcription.

I can be typing an email, working on a spreadsheet, or using my mouse—and the moment a thought hits me, I just start speaking. My computer picks it up instantly and transcribes everything. No keyboard shortcuts, no clicking buttons, no switching windows.

This has transformed how I work. Before, I'd lose ideas because I was in the middle of something else. Now, whether I'm deep in a task or walking around my office, I can capture every thought the moment it occurs. It's like having a personal assistant who never misses anything.

I was getting terrible wrist pain from typing all day, which led me to explore voice transcription. But the commercial apps wanted $30/month for basic features. So I built Whispering - a free, open-source alternative where you bring your own API key.

The productivity gains are real: zero friction for thought capture, no more forgotten ideas, and I can work while pacing around (which keeps me energized). Plus my wrists don't hurt anymore.

The video shows this in action - you can see how seamlessly it fits into any workflow.
